In Airport Landing Challenge, you will guide planes by clicking on them and drawing a path for them to follow. Each plane must land on a runway that matches its color. Be careful—letting planes get too close to each other could cause a crash, which will end the game.

# How to Play
- Click on a plane to select it.
- Draw a line to guide the plane to its correct landing lane.
- Make sure planes don’t crash by avoiding collisions and keeping a safe distance between them.
- In special levels, help planes navigate fires, avoid tornadoes, and land before they run out of fuel!

In this level, random fires break out on the runway, and it's up to you to guide the planes to fly over them and extinguish the flames. Make sure to stay on course while avoiding collisions—every crash could bring the challenge to an end. Can you clear the skies and put out the fires in time?

## Low Fuel Emergency

In this level, some planes are running dangerously low on fuel! Your task is to guide these planes to their landing lanes before they run out of fuel and crash. Time is critical—make sure you prioritize the low-fuel planes and land them safely. Can you manage the pressure and keep the skies clear of disasters?

## Tornado Survival Mode

Brace yourself for the ultimate challenge in Tornado Survival Mode! Set in a vast desert, this mode is filled with unpredictable tornadoes that make controlling the planes nearly impossible. These powerful storms will send planes off course, and you must navigate them carefully to avoid disaster. Stay alert, dodge the tornadoes, and land the planes safely on their designated runways before the storm takes full control. Can you survive the wild winds and prove your air traffic control skills?


# Key Features:
- Color-coded landing lanes for each plane.
- Random events, such as fires and low fuel, to increase the challenge.
- Dodging tornadoes in Tornado Survival Mode.
- Precise control mechanics, allowing you to draw paths for each plane.
